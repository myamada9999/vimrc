Change key like following because I don't like to move hand 
for ESC/Zenkaku_Hankaku key in vim.

Henkan   => ESC
Muhenkan => Zenkaku_Hankaku


1. Check keycode, keysym.

 $ xev

Then, put Henkan, Muhenkan, ESC, Han/Zen Kanji.
You can find keynum and keysym by each key.
In my environment, keynum and keysym show like below.

 keynum 100
Hankaku keycode ESC


2. Create .xmodmaprc file.

keycode [$KEYNUM] = [$KEYSYM]

Set KEYNUM is keynum for Henkan and Muhenkan.
Set KEYSYM is keysym for ESC and Zenkaku_Hankaku.

Example: .xmodmaprc

 keycode 100 = Escape
 keycode 102 = Zenkaku_Hankaku


3. Set .xmodmaprc file in .bashrc file.

Example: .bashrc

 xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc
